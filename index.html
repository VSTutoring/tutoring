						When I was 14, I taught myself math up to calculus—and enjoyed every moment of it. 
						This material is fundamental to advanced fields, 
						and it's a stepping stone for developing passion in STEM. 
						I'll share the strategies that allowed me to learn calculus by myself, 
						score a 5 on the AP Calculus BC exam as a high school freshman (without taking the class)
						and retain the information well enough to teach others. 
						Learning should be self-oriented; 
						we'll do so in a supportive, nonjudgmental environment—centered on <i>your</i> progress.
						My explanations have been fine-tuned to 
						best help the material <i>click</i> for you.

				<h2>Our Process</h2>
			</div>
				<div class="container">
					<p>
						<b>STEP 1 (PRE-SESSION). </b>
						I consult with you over text to set goals and pinpoint problem areas. 
						Students who struggle often carry knowledge gaps from prior math classes—for example, 
						a calculus student who doesn't grasp the unit circle,
						or a precalculus student who can't factor.
						Once we've outlined a plan for our session, 
						we'll schedule a meeting time.
						<figure class="process-img">
							<img src="assets/images/process/before-img.jpg" alt="">
						</figure>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>STEP 2 (THE SESSION). </b>
						In our session, we can work through math problems you struggle with. 
						(To minimize delays, email me the problems in advance!)
						I can also design exercises specifically 
						for your weaknesses. 
						If we've identified knowledge gaps from prior math classes,
						then we'll review these concepts while working through the <q>on-level</q> problem.
						As the session ends, I'll note your progress and where we stand—and provide you 
						recommendations for further study.
						<figure class="process-img">
							<img src="assets/images/process/during-img.jpg" alt="">
						</figure>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>STEP 3 (AFTER THE SESSION). </b>
						After we finish, I'll give you my scrap work or share our whiteboard for you to review. 
						I'll then offer you some additional resources, such as 
						worked-out examples or videos.
						I recommend that you rework the problems we did 
						so that everything sticks.

						<p>
							<b>ALGEBRA.</b> 
							The language of math and physics, 
							algebra is the generalization of numbers and operations with numbers. 
							I tutor Algebra I, Algebra II and College Algebra.
							(Algebra courses typically discuss 
							linear functions and inequalities,
							systems of linear equations, domain and range,
							exponent properties, 
							the quadratic formula, completing the square, 
							zeros of polynomials, dividing polynomials,
							and logarithms.)
							Algebra is the most important skill for a student's math success.
							Skill gaps in algebra snowball into bigger problems later on, 
							so it's important that we learn algebra well—and develop a set of good math 
							procedures and study habits.

					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<p id="offerings-geometry">
							<b>GEOMETRY.</b> 
							Geometry is the study of everything with space, 
							such as shapes, distances and relative positions. 
							(A high school geometry course teaches 
							rotations, reflections and dilations; 
							similar and congruent triangles; constructing proofs 
							of geometric identities; 
							right triangles and the Pythagorean theorem;
							distance and midpoints; 
							circle theorems and arc length; rational functions;
							and equations of circles.)
							These topics are highly applicable to physics 
							and calculus.
							We'll ensure that you go beyond memorization 
							by <i>understanding</i>, through abundant 
							visual presentations and how they connect to algebra.

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<p id="offerings-trig">
							<b>TRIGONOMETRY.</b> 
							Trigonometry is the study based on triangles,
							their side lengths and their angles.
							(A trigonometry course covers 
							right triangles, the unit circle,
							the six trigonometric functions and their graphs, 
							the laws of sine and cosine,
							trigonometric identities and proofs, and periodic behavior.)
							These topics are notoriously tricky;
							right triangles are suddenly extended to circles, waves and oscillations—the 
							connection many students miss.
							But trigonometry is a fundamental stepping stone to calculus and physics,
							where struggling students often lack a solid foundation in trigonometry.
							Solid performance in trigonometry is therefore essential for future success. 
							From formula sheets to animations, I've built a collection 
							of resources to help you ace this subject—and succeed in your future classes.

						<p id="offerings-precalc">
							<b>PRECALCULUS.</b> 
							By building mathematical maturity,
							precalculus gears students for the next step—calculus. 
							(A precalculus course covers a variety of topics—for example, 
							transforming graphs, inverse functions, end behavior, conic sections,
							exponential and logarithmic equations, the number <i>e</i>, 
							compound interest, polar and parametric functions, 
							vectors and matrices, and an introduction to limits and continuity.)
							Students struggle in calculus because they lack the appropriate background in precalculus. 
							Through formula sheets and practice tests,
							we'll drill in the necessary math you need for success in this course—and in calculus.

							<b>CALCULUS.</b> 
							Calculus is the study of continuous change
							as it applies to rates of change and accumulation.
							My specialty lies in tutoring 
							Calculus I, Calculus II,
							Calculus III and AP Calculus; 
							I have a deep understanding of students' common problem areas 
							and how to rectify them.
							Whereas other math classes cover many topics, 
							calculus contains four components—limits, derivatives, integrals and series—in major depth. 
							(So a student who fails to understand derivatives cannot 
							proceed with integration.)
							Through my flexibility with calculus syllabi and methods (early transcendentals and late transcendentals), 
							I've been the #1 source for conducive learning for years—and 
							for sharing passion to make students love calculus and its applications.
							I've written mock AP Calculus exams in addition to developing 
							thousands of exercises with full examples,
							and I have extensive experience consulting and correcting other tutors.

						<p id="offerings-statistics">
							<b>STATISTICS.</b> 
							The study of collecting samples and manipulating data, statistics
							has a foot in every major discipline—from the natural sciences
							to physics to weather forecasting. 
							I tutor general and AP Statistics, as well as introductory college statistics courses.
							(A statistics class generally covers 
							mean, median and mode; standard deviation; percentiles; standardization 
							and <i>z</i>-scores; linear regression and residuals; random sample procedures; 
							computing probability; random variables and probability distributions; sampling distributions; 
							<i>z-</i> and <i>t-</i>tests; confidence intervals; 
							chi-square tests; inference with the slope; and ANOVA.)
							Statistics requires students to <q>think for themselves</q>;
							they must know when to use the provided formulas 
							and which test is appropriate.
							Through analogies and case studies, 
							we'll be sure you master the statistical procedures 
							and be able to apply them.

						<p id="offerings-physics">
							<b>PHYSICS.</b> 
							Physics is the fundamental science; every scientific field is based on physical principles. 
							I tutor Physics I and II, AP Physics 1 and 2, and AP Physics C: Mechanics 
							and AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism.
							Physics courses are known to be notoriously difficult,
							especially if a student lacks the necessary math foundations. 
							Unlike math courses, physics requires students to put together puzzle pieces—it 
							isn't enough to just memorize formulas. 
							Students may not know where to start if they find themselves lost in physics.
							With my experience as a physics teacher assistant (TA),
							I'm trained to lead students on the path to success 
							and develop critical-thinking skills. 
							My experience grading tests allows me to scope common misunderstandings
							and create comprehensive drill problems.
							(Students often memorize formulas but don't know how or when to apply them.)
							With enough practice and a professional at your side,
							the dragon isn't so hard to tame after all.
